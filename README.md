# AppiumScripts
Figuring out the Appium eco system with iOS and Android

These scripts are done in Eclipse just cuz it's been forever since I used it and I wanted to see if it's worth useing if you already have Android Studio.
Probasbly will switch to Visual Studio Code as soon as I get the dependencies worked out.
